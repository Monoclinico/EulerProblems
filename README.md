<h1>Description</h1>  
<p>  
I have put here more detailed information about scripts I wrote to solve many problems that are in ProjectEuler.net. I created these small programs with Python as experiments to solve the mathematical problems presented in the described site in the most efficient and fast way that I could do.<br/>
If you think you can improve the code, I'll be very grateful if you could help improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.<br/>

<h2>Problems</h2>  

<ul>
  
<li>

Problem 1:<br/>
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.<br/>

Problem 2:<br/>
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br/>

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
<br/>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.<br/>
